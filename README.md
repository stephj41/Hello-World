# Hello-World
I am very slowly working through the book *Learn Ruby the Hard Way* and so far, I think I am making progress.  While I have been using Github in a private repository for years, I have only added and viewed issues and viewed PRs for an organization. Now its time to create.  I will continue to use this account as I move through the books on Ruby and learn this madness!
